# Test Data Structure

This directory contains test data for different APIs used in the project. Data is organized by API/service for clarity and maintainability.

## Structure

- `dwd_weather/` — Test data for DWD Weather API
- `google/` — Test data for Google API
- `rmv/` — Test data for RMV API
- `wifi/` — Test data for WiFi info

## File Naming
- Files are named by the type of data they contain (e.g., `current_weather.json`, `stopinfo.json`).
- If multiple versions or scenarios are needed, use suffixes (e.g., `departure_case1.json`).

## Adding New Data
- Place new test data in the appropriate subfolder.
- Update this README if you add new categories or change the structure.
